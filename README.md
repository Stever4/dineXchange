dineXchange is a web-based application that creates a marketplace for freshmen to sell excess dining dollars to upperclassmen at Carnegie Mellon University. Because dining dollars are less versatile than actual dollars, they are worth less. Therefore, freshmen can convert dining dollars that would typically go to waste into actual dollars, and upperclassmen can buy meals on campus at a discount.

Through dineXchange, freshmen can check into a dining location, indicating that they are willing and available to sell excess dining dollars. Upperclassmen can check if any freshmen are looking to sell dining dollars at their dining location, and if there are, dineXchange will facilitate a real-time bargaining process to determine the details of the transaction. After the price has determined, the two parties can meet up to complete the deal.

tl;dr Freshmen sell dining dollars to upperclassmen. Everyone profits.
